# EdgeTX_Custom_Sounds

This repository is for custom audio tracks and sounds for EdgeTX that I have created.  Download and extract the zip file and place the .wav files in the appropriate radio folder.  Most tracks will go in the /SOUNDS/en folder.  Change the "en" to your language if you are not using English.
